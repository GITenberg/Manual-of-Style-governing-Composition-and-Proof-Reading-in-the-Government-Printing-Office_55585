<p>Clear and positive rules for composition and proof reading are needed in printing
offices to prevent confusion and unnecessary delay and expense. Inflexible rules for
style in all works can not be given, but for the general work of the Government
Printing Office the rules herein contained will be observed. When important
changes are to be made, written or printed instructions will be furnished or there
will be a special preparation of copy.</p>

<p>All persons connected with the typographical divisions of this office are requested
to preserve this book and study carefully and well the rules and suggestions offered
for their guidance.</p>

<p>Department editors are requested to make their copy conform as nearly as possible
to the style here presented, and to specify fully when sending work to this office
any general deviation therefrom that may be desired.</p>

<h2><a name="SUGGESTIONS_TO_AUTHORS" id="SUGGESTIONS_TO_AUTHORS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">SUGGESTIONS TO AUTHORS.</a></h2>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>Authors are advised to so prepare their copy that it can be clearly understood by
the printer. Nothing should be left for conjecture. Measurable perfection can be
secured by first transcribing copy on the typewriter, and before releasing it for
publication giving it as careful revision as is afterwards given proof sheets. In
the end this will not only save time, but Department printing funds frequently
exhausted in making author’s corrections in proof will be available for other work.
Typewritten copy is always preferable, when not on paper too thin, but plain copy
is absolutely essential to good work.</p>

<p>The following are offered as suggestions which, if heeded, will enable this office to
achieve the best results:</p>

<p>1. All paragraphs should be clearly marked on copy, thus avoiding vexatious misprints
due to overrunning in proof.</p>

<p>2. Objects, photographs, or drawings for illustration should accompany manuscript.
Each should bear the name of the publication to which it belongs, together
with the figure or plate number, and necessary titles or legends for the same should be
inserted at the proper place in copy. A complete list of plates and figures should
always accompany the paper.</p>

<p>3. When a work is made up of several parts, or papers, a carefully prepared schedule
of the desired arrangement should be forwarded with the manuscript.</p>

<p>4. Proper names and technical terms should be plainly and carefully written,
using <span class="fs80">CAPITAL</span> letters if necessary, and each should be verified before the copy is
sent to the printer.</p>

<p>5. Details of capitalization and punctuation may be safely left to the printers and
proof readers. It is part of their profession; they make a study of the subject, and
will generally meet the author’s taste.</p>

<p>6. Write only on one side of the paper. When printed matter covering more than
one side of a sheet is used as copy, a <span class="fs80">DUPLICATE</span> should be furnished; otherwise much
trouble is caused in cutting.</p>

<p>7. When, as an afterthought, new matter making more than a line is inserted, it
should be written on a separate sheet and the place for its insertion clearly indicated.</p>

<p>8. Galley proofs will be furnished when desired. It is important that all corrections
be made on the first proofs; later ones should be used only for purposes of
verification.</p>

<p>9. Corrections in stereotype or electrotype plates usually do more harm than good.
They weaken the plate and render new errors probable through damaged letters.</p>

<p>10. Authors and compilers are requested to direct those handling their manuscript
to transmit the same to the Printing Office in flat form&mdash;never to roll it if it can
be avoided.</p>

signature proper prominence. It is well to have a white line between text and
signature, but this is not imperative; general appearance must govern. Signatures
are placed at the right of the page, indented 1, 3, or 5 ems from the right, as
may be necessary; addresses are placed to the left, flush if at the top of a paper,
indented one em if at the bottom, italic lines following indented as much as necessary
to a good appearance. Do not use slugs to separate dash lines from signature or
address lines where the dash will bear off one or more blank lines if solid. The following
examples cover the most common forms:</p>

<p>24. Titles preceding names will always be capitalized: Senior Warden Brown;
Grand Master Williamson; Master Workman Sovereign; Sergeant Murphy; Private
O’Donnell; Boatswain Given; Tinsmith Harris, etc.</p>

<p>25. Lower-case participles derived from proper names, such as anglicized, frenchified,
romanized, gallicized; also adjective or qualifying nouns indirectly derived
from and compounded with proper names, as tropical, arctic, transatlantic, etc.</p>

<p>26. Geographic zones or sections of the world, when used as proper nouns, take
the capital, as the Tropics, the Arctics, the Levant, the Orient. When used as
adjectives, use lower-case, as antarctic ice, tropical plants, oriental customs, levantine
silk, morocco or russia leather, china or wedgwood pottery. Such words as
india rubber, india ink, paris green, london purple, prussian blue, venetian red,
roman type, gothic letter (but Gothic architecture), that describe things and are
also used as nouns, do not take the capital, although they are, or are derived from,
proper names.</p>

<p>27. Capitalize titles clearly intended as synonyms of proper names. Examples:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">
<p>You will go, Major, to New York.</p>
<p>I am anxious about our friend, the Captain.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to a point of order.</p>
<p>I am, General, your obedient servant.</p>
</div>

<p>28. Titles not clearly used as synonyms, or when used in a general way, will not be
capitalized. Examples:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">
<p>He was taken before the judge.</p>
<p>The captain was breveted.</p>
</div>

<p>29. Where the word “o’clock” occurs in phrases or headlines involving the use of
capitals, always set it “o’clock;” never use the form o’Clock, O’Clock, or O’clock.</p>

<p>30. In caps-and-small-caps cross headings, or headings of any kind in which capitals
are used, capitalize principal words. [Copy preparers will take full responsibility
for uniformity in this matter and mark copy plainly.]</p>

<p>31. In tables of contents which are set in small caps capitalize only the first word
and proper names.</p>

<p>32. Capitalize the titles of standing and select committees of the Senate and House
of Representatives of the United States and the different forms of the same, both
singular and plural, as Committee on Ways and Means; Ways and Means Committees.
The following list gives the official nomenclature of Congressional committees, with

<p>7. Fractions, when spelled, will be compounded: One twenty-first, one-fifth,
eighty-one one-hundredths, one one-hundredth, the one-hundredth part.</p>

<p>8. The words “well,” “so,” and “ill” will be used as follows: He is an ill-tempered
man; he is very ill tempered. Well-meant intentions; his intentions are well
meant. His so-called poem; his poem (so called) is, etc. But generally adverbs are
not compounded with adjectives which they qualify: A divinely inspired book; a
finely modeled statue; a nicely kept lawn.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="USE_OF_FIGURES" id="USE_OF_FIGURES"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">USE OF FIGURES.</a></h2>


<p>1. Where figures are used to express the time of day, use the period to separate
the hours and minutes: It was 5.30 p. m.; 10.02 a. m.</p>

<p>2. Use degree and minute marks after figures in all cases referring to degrees and
minutes, and where whole numbers and decimals are used place the marks after the
decimals, as 14.25°; 13.5′; 24.36″.</p>

<p>3. In straight matter and reading columns of tables, where decimal fractions occur
without a unit, put a cipher in the unit’s place: 0.38; but a .38-caliber revolver.</p>

<p>4. Omit the comma in serial numbers: No. 165473; section 2436.</p>

<p>5. Use inferior figures in all chemical symbols, and omit spaces between the letters
and signs.</p>

<p>6. Use superior figures in connection with reference letters, as A<sup>1</sup>, A<sup>2</sup>, <em>a</em><sup>1</sup>, <em>a</em><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>7. It is impossible to give definite rules that will govern in all cases as to what
should go in figures and what should be spelled out. It is a question which must
be left to the judgment of the workman. General rules which will serve as a guide
to the tendency of the style follow:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Put in figures</span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p><b>Distances</b>: 50 miles; 17 yards; 8 leagues.</p>

<p><b>Clock time</b>: 10.25 p. m.; 12 o’clock and 30 minutes; half past 9.</p>

<p><b>Weights</b>: 12 pounds of beef; 4 hundredweight of stone; 8 centals of wheat; 2 grams of powder.</p>

<p><b>Measures</b>: 40 bushels of wheat; 1 gallon of wine; 15 knots; 6 acres; 9 hectares.</p>

<p><b>Degrees, etc.</b>: 17° 24′ 17″; 10° below zero; in longitude 46° west (but tenth meridian of longitude,
sixth degree of latitude, etc.).</p>

<p><b>Dimensions</b>: 16 feet square; 24 by (not x) 12 feet; 2 by 6 inch plank; 4 kilometers square.</p>

<p><b>Percentage</b>: 15 per cent; 27.4 per cent; but one-half of 1 per cent, etc.</p>

<p><b>Money</b>: $2 per 100 pounds; $1.37½ per bale; 35 cents apiece; a 25-cent piece; 20 francs.</p>

<p><b>Age</b>: My age is 52 years and 6 months; a boy 6 years old; 3-year-old colt; 3-months-old child; wine
8 years old (but a boy about six years old; wine four or five years old&mdash;where indefinite and
isolated, spell out).</p>

<p><b>Population</b>: The population of Chicago is 1,000,000, of whom 150,000 are voters; a hamlet of 18 persons.
(But see <a href="#SPELL_OUT_9">paragraphs 9 and 10 under “Spell out.”</a>)</p>

<p><b>Bonds or stocks</b>: Gold is 109; Metropolitan Railroad, 109; 5-20 bonds; 10-40 bonds; 7.30 bonds; 3.65
bonds; 4½ per cent bonds; 3 per cent bonds; 3½ percents; 4 percents. Where the word “bonds”
does not follow the designating expression, spell out, as five-twenties, ten-forties, three-sixty-fives,
four-and-a-halfs, threes, etc.</p>

<p><b>Votes, ballots, etc.</b>: 75 votes; 50 ballots; 300 voters; 167 Democrats; 14 majority.</p>

<p><b>Definite enumerations</b> (when of a statistical character): 275 persons, 6 sleek horses, 20 head of sheep,
9 dusty travelers; 43 reports, covering 109 pages. (But see <a href="#SPELL_OUT_9">paragraph 9 under “Spell out.”</a>)</p>

<p><b>Dates</b>: June 29, A. D. 1882; December 6, 1846; the 1st of January, 1883; June 12; the 5th instant; the
20th day of March; the 1st (day) of the month. July 4, 1776, was the great day which gave to the
world the celebrated Declaration of Independence, and now our Fourth of July is something to be
remembered by all patriotic Americans; 4th of July claims.</p>

<p><b>Serial numbers</b>: Section 3; No. 1728; paragraph 247; page 125; volume 6 (or Volume VI, as written);
1536 Ninth street; Route No. 17342; clerk of class 3.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Spell out</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Length of time: It lasted fifteen years; we were three days on the way; four
hours and ten minutes.</p>

<p>2. Amounts or numbers larger than 1,000, if spelled, are expressed thus: One
thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars; A.&nbsp;D. eighteen hundred and fifty; number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
seventeen hundred and twenty-two. But in serial numbers, where even multiples
of one thousand occur, use the word “thousand,” as section two thousand and four
(not twenty hundred and four); paragraph seven thousand and sixty-nine.</p>

<p>3. When beginning a sentence: Five million dollars’ worth; in other cases,
$5,000,000 worth.</p>

<p>4. All amounts beginning sentences or paragraphs, except when, in testimony, an
answer begins with a serial or complex number, in which case use figures. Examples:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">
<p>Q. In what year was that?&mdash;A. 1876.</p>
<p>Q. What was the amount involved?&mdash;A. $101.50.</p>
<p>Q. How much was the sum?&mdash;A. Five (or fifteen, or sixty-seven) dollars.</p>
</div>

<p>5. Numbered streets of all cities, except in tabular matter.</p>

<p>6. Regimental numbers of United States Regular or Volunteer Army, as Eighth
Infantry, One hundred and ninth Ohio Regiment, Third Massachusetts Cavalry.</p>

<p>7. Sums of money, when they are referred to in a general way, as “four or five
millions,” or “I would not contribute one dollar to such a purpose.” [This is not
to be construed as meaning round numbers, but simply a general or indefinite statement.]</p>

<p>8. Isolated fractions not connected with whole numbers, as one-fourth, three-tenths.</p>

<div><a name="SPELL_OUT_9" id="SPELL_OUT_9"></a></div>
<p>9. Isolated enumerations less than 10: “I saw three men at work.” “There were
four horses in the field.”</p>

<p>10. Number of persons, when not in statistical matter or when general or indefinite:
“There were thirty or forty persons in the town.”</p>

<p>11. When numbers are mentioned casually, or by way of illustration, or in connection
with serious and dignified subjects, they should be spelled out:</p>

<p><b><em>Box heads</em></b>.&mdash;Box heads should be run across whenever practicable; if it is necessary
to run them up, reduce to the minimum depth.</p>

<p>In boxes of two or more lines which run across, or where two or more boxes occur
in the same head, use en quads above and below the greater number of lines.</p>

<p>In boxes of three lines or more in depth and 10 ems or more in width over reading
columns or over several figure columns, and in all run-up heads of three lines or
more, make hanging indention; otherwise center each line.</p>

<p>In boxes containing two lines the first line must be the longer when possible.</p>

<p><b><em>Contractions</em></b>.&mdash;In columns of names of persons, follow copy in the use of contractions
of given names; but to avoid overruns always contract such names as William
and Charles. Use “Co.” for “Company” where the name of the company is given;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
use “R. R.” for railroad and “Rwy.” for railway where the name of the railroad or
railway is given, and use Bro. and Bros. in firm names. Contract names of months
whenever the day of the month is given, excepting in first columns consisting of
dates only, which may, however, be contracted to save overruns. All other well-known
contractions can be used, by direction of copy preparer, to save overruns.
The following contractions for months of the year will be used:</p>

<p><b><em>Use of “dittoes.”</em></b>&mdash;Ditto whenever it can properly be done, and ditto under blank
spaces in all cases excepting center heads, but never ditto under leaders.</p>

<p>In columns less than 6 ems in width use 1½ ems of quads (in addition to en quad
used for bearing off) or 2 ems of leaders, as may be required, before the “do.”; in
columns of 6 ems and over, use 2 ems of quads (in addition to en quad used for bearing
off) or 2½ ems of leaders.</p>

<p>In first columns, where flush headings are used with indentions under them, proportionate
allowance must be made for those indentions, and it will generally be
indicated by the copy preparer.</p>

<p><b><em>Date columns.</em></b>&mdash;In 7-em date columns, bear off 3-em space from rules, use only en
commas after day of month, and put the remaining space between month and day.
Observe same style in 5-em date columns, with the exception of using en quads
instead of 3-em spaces in bearing off from rules.</p>

<p>Ditto in both 5 and 7 em columns.</p>

<p><b><em>Leading from top or bottom lines</em></b>.&mdash;Where there is only one reading column, lead
from the bottom; if more than one, from the top.</p>

<p>Date columns are not classified as reading columns in connection with leading from
top line.</p>

<p>In parallel tables, where the lines are numbered on the outside of each page, lead
from the top.</p>

<p>Where the last word in a leader line runs close to the rule, use en leader if space
permits; if not, use a thin space, but never use a full point, excepting where a reference
mark follows an abbreviation.</p>

<p>Unless specially directed otherwise, continue leaders across entire width of tables
when the right-hand columns are of figures; when the last column is a reading
column, omit the leaders from that column only.</p>

<p><b><em>Figures in reading columns</em></b>.&mdash;Numerical expressions in reading columns will be
expressed in figures, even at the beginning of the sentence: 155 days from Dec. 1;
trains 3 times a day.</p>

<p><b><em>Figures from or against rules.</em></b>&mdash;In figure columns bear off an en quad from rules on
right of figures; and so make the cast as to bear off the longest line of figures an en
quad from the rule on the left where possible. If crowded, and but few figures will
touch, close up on the left; if still more crowded, close up on the right. If found
necessary to set the figures in one column against the rule on the right (which, by
the way, must always be done before closing up on the left when the mass of figures is
of nearly even width), do the same with the remaining columns of the table. Exceptions
will be marked by copy preparer.</p>

<p>Common fractions to be set against rules unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p><b><em>Decimals.</em></b>&mdash;In columns of figures containing decimals omit the point and ciphers
where no decimal occurs. This rule does not apply to money columns consisting of
both dollars and cents, where the points and ciphers will be used. Always align
the decimal points.</p>

<p><b><em>Dollar mark.</em></b>&mdash;Repeat dollar mark under rules in continuous tables; also in leader
work where center heads occur indicating a separate or independent statement. But
in statements where amounts are added to make a general aggregate do not repeat
the dollar mark, even where center heads occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><b><em>Parallel dashes.</em></b>&mdash;Use parallel dashes in figure columns in all cases where necessary
to cut off from figures following. This rule will apply also to leader work.</p>

<p><b><em>Tables in rules.</em></b>&mdash;In tables inclosed in rules, where the first column consists of figures,
do not use leaders. [This rule will not apply to date columns or to reading
columns clearly requiring leaders.] Bear off matter one em from side rules.</p>

<p><b><em>Full point in leader lines.</em></b>&mdash;Use full point between abbreviation and reference mark
in leader lines, as Boston, Mass.† ...</p>

<p><b><em>Blanks for center heads.</em></b>&mdash;Use full blank line above and below all center heads in
stubs or reading columns, excepting where leaders run back far enough to clear the
head, in which case use only a line of en quads below.</p>

<p><b><em>Plus and minus marks.</em></b>&mdash;Plus and minus marks in figure columns must be aligned
when occurring at left of figures.</p>

<p><b><em>Dates and figures in reading columns.</em></b>&mdash;Do not range dates or figures in first or reading
columns unless figures are added up to make a total. This rule will apply also
to leader work.</p>

<p><b><em>En-quadded tables.</em></b>&mdash;Use en quads in runovers [copy preparers will give instructions
when change is desired]; scabbard will not be allowed; all box heads solid.</p>

<p><b><em>Reference marks.</em></b>&mdash;Set off all reference marks a 5-em space when preceding words
or figures. Use superior figures (<sup>1</sup>, <sup>2</sup>, <sup>3</sup>, etc.) for reference marks and footnotes in all
cases, unless otherwise instructed. In a series of short footnotes range the reference
marks, and also the first letter of the note.</p>

<p><b><em>Words in figure columns.</em></b>&mdash;Range all words occurring in figure columns one en from
rule on right; also capitalize and use full point.</p>

<p><b><em>Indention from rules.</em></b>&mdash;An indention from a rule means so many ems in addition to
the en quad used for bearing off.</p>

<p><b><em>Word “number.”</em></b>&mdash;Spell the word “number,” referring to quantity or things, in box
heads where possible. Where necessary to abbreviate or where used in connection
with serial figures, use “No.”</p>

<p><b><em>Flush and sub heads.</em></b>&mdash;Use colons after flush heads and em dashes after heads subordinate
thereto.</p>

<p><b><em>Units of quantity.</em></b>&mdash;Units of quantity to the right of reading columns and over figure
columns will be spelled where possible. Where the space available demands a contraction,
use the following forms: Dolls., galls., lbs., oz., bbls., cwt., yds., ft., in.
(inches), doz., bush., M, sq. feet, M feet, cub. feet, kilo., kilos. Observe style of the
following table:</p>

<p>4. “Line of stars” means seven asterisks in a full-measure line, indented two
ems at each end, the remaining space to be evenly divided between the stars. Exception:
In briefs, etc., set in “general-order” measure, use but five asterisks, indented
two ems at each end.</p>

<p>5. Avoid, by overrunning, the use of a dash at the beginning of a line, two-letter
divisions, and the repetition of divisions at the end of three or more contiguous lines.</p>

<p>6. After addresses at the head of communications use the period, as&mdash;</p>

<div class="textcol2">
<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">Amos J. Cummings</span>,</p>
<p><span class="pad4"><em>House of Representatives</em>.</span></p>
<p><span class="pad2"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I have the honor, etc.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="textcol2">
<p>Lieut. Commander <span class="smcap">Richard Rush</span>,</p>
<p><span class="pad10"><em>Navy Department</em>.</span></p>
<p><span class="pad1"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: The care shown by you, etc.</span></p>
</div>

<p>7. Use en quads in cap and small-cap lines in addresses and in signatures, and a
proportionate increase of space in heads of extended type.</p>

<p>8. In illustrating certain shapes or forms, as <b>⟙</b> rails, use gothic letters (case 288
cap. in long-primer text, and case 287 cap. in brevier text).</p>

<p>9. In solid matter, when extracts, etc., are set in smaller type, separate by using
two leads; in leaded matter use three leads.</p>

<p>10. Use two leads before footnotes in all cases.</p>

<p>11. Where slugs are called for specially, use a slug of same body as type.</p>

<p>12. Separate center heads from text by slugs one size less than type used.</p>

<p>13. When two consecutive years are intended, set: 1875&ndash;76, 1801&ndash;2; when more
than two consecutive years are intended: 1875&ndash;1879, 1895&ndash;1904; when two or more
distinct years are intended: 1894, 1895; 1873, 1876; 1888, 1891, 1894.</p>

<p>14. When laws are set in long-primer type, document measure, the first line of the
enacting clause must be set so as to conform to the following examples:</p>

<p class="large"><em>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United</em></p>

<p class="large"><em>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States</em></p>

<p>15. In indexes, when the page folios overrun, retain only the first folio number in
the leader line; but when necessary to save an overrun, figures may be run back to
within an em leader of the words. When the folios overrunning make two or more
lines, indent evenly not less than seven ems on the left, the folios in excess of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'even. length'">even-length</ins>
lines to be worked into the leader line. When the figures extend back into
the leader line, use an en quad between the leaders and the first figure.</p>

<p>16. Never divide a word in a headline if it can possibly be avoided. In subhead
and legend lines it is not necessary to make the first line full.</p>

<p>17. Always keep together, at the beginning or end of a line, such abbreviations as
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N.; D.&nbsp;C.; N.&nbsp;Y.; N.&nbsp;J.; M.&nbsp;D., etc. The contractions esq., sr., and jr. should
always be in the same line with the name they follow.</p>

<p>18. Never divide the last word of a paragraph if it can be avoided; overrun if
necessary. The last line of a paragraph should contain at least a four-letter word.</p>

<h2><a name="BILL_STYLE" id="BILL_STYLE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">BILL STYLE.</a></h2>
<hr class="r15" />

<p>Unless special directions are given&mdash;sometimes necessary in particular cases&mdash;the
following rules govern the printing of bills:</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100 bold">Type.</p>

<p>1. Bills are always set in English type, full-slugged.</p>

<p>2. A new bill is always all roman, italic being used only for the enacting clause
and the word “<em>Provided</em>.”</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100 bold">Side Folios.</p>

<p>3. The direction “Allow for two figures” means that TWO 1-EM quads (not one
2-em quad) are to be used in allowing for side folios at left of text. “Allow for
three figures” means indent two 1-em quads and 1 en quad.</p>

<p>4. Always supply the word “That” immediately following the section number,
and after the word “<em>Provided</em>” of a proviso.</p>

<p>5. Begin side folios with figure 1 at the first line of each section. Exceptions to
this are sometimes made for convenience in handling, and side folios begun with
figure 1 at the top of each page; but in such cases special instructions will be given.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100 bold">Engrossed and Enrolled Bills.</p>

<p>6. A bill is said to be <em>engrossed</em> when it has passed one House of Congress; to be
<em>enrolled</em> when final action has been taken in both Houses.</p>

<p>7. Follow literally in engrossed and enrolled bills. This applies to the title of
the bill on the filing or indorsement as well as to the text, but not to the caption of
engrossed amendments.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100 bold">Heads and Indorsements.</p>

<p>8. The “indorsement” on a bill is the form printed on the back for convenience
of reference when folded. “Document style” prevails on indorsements until the
bill reaches the “engrossed” stage. Senate bills differ from House bills in the
forms used in heads and indorsements. As a bill progresses new “actions” appear,
which should be set in the same style as the “actions” that precede. The “style”
of a head or indorsement is governed by the “style” for the branch of Congress in
which the bill is pending. Examples of a new bill in each House are given on the
following page:</p>

<p>9. In indorsements on bills in the Senate use a 9-em dash under the bill number;
on bills in the House a parallel dash.</p>

<p>10. The name of the introducer of a bill or resolution is carried under the title in
the indorsement, in long primer caps and small caps, between parallel rules, in
both Houses, through each printing until bill or resolution passes one House.</p>

<p>11. When the title of a bill on the indorsement makes more than two lines, indent
the runovers 1½ ems; center the title when it makes but one or two lines. On the
face of the bill where a title makes more than one line, set the first line to full
measure, centering the runover if there be two lines in the title; if more than two
lines, indent the runovers 2 ems.</p>

<p>12. Titles for <span class="smcap">House bills</span> are taken from the <span class="fs80">INDORSEMENT</span> of copy; for <span class="smcap">Senate
bills</span> from the <span class="fs80">FACE</span> of copy.</p>

<p>13. Preambles are set full measure, the first line of each “whereas” being flush
and the runovers indented 2 ems. Where an agreement or treaty is part of a preamble,
follow literally, indenting the paragraphs 4 ems and runovers 2 ems, full
measure.</p>

<p>14. Titles and preambles following the head of a bill are always half-slugged.</p>

<p>15. Set “Calendar No.&mdash;,” on both face and indorsement of bills which have reached
the Senate Calendar, in each case at the upper right-hand corner.</p>

<p>16. Set “Report No.” on both face and indorsement of reported bills in both Houses,
centering under the number of the bill.</p>

<p>[It is impracticable to give illustrations of the minutiæ of headings and indorsements
of bills in all their stages. Samples and information can always be had upon
inquiry at the foreman’s desk. Compositors and others must familiarize themselves
with the forms called for by the clerks’ notes on copy.]</p>

<p class="p1 pfs100 bold">Amendments.</p>

<p>17. “Line type” and italic are used only to show amendments. When it is proposed
to strike out certain portions in a bill that is “reported with amendments,”
such portions will be set in “line type.” Example:</p>

<p class="noindent xl">
in accordance with <span class="thru">existing</span> <em>proposed</em> plan, <span class="thru">twenty</span> <em>twenty-five</em>
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>18. When new matter is inserted, it is set in italics.</p>

<p>19. When it is proposed to strike out and insert, always let the italics <span class="fs80">FOLLOW</span>
the line type.</p>

<p>20. Do not complicate amendments. When one amendment can be made to cover
the sense, as in the complete changing of a sum of money, so set it, rather than divide
into two or more short amendments.</p>

<p>21. Proposed Senate amendments are printed in bill form, all roman. The general
style of the head may be either that of bills or of “miscellaneous documents.” These
headings are generally in proper form as they come from the bill clerk.</p>

<p>22. When it is proposed in the Senate to make several short amendments, the
caption should read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p class="center">AMENDMENTS</p>

<p>Intended to be proposed by Mr. <span class="smcap">Hoar</span> to the bill (H. R. 4864) to reduce taxation, to provide revenue
for the Government, and for other purposes, viz:</p>

<p>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In line 24, page 19, strike out the words “per centum ad valorem” and insert the words</p>
<p>2 &nbsp; “cents per pound;” in line 16, page 25, strike out the word “shall;” and in line 12, page 34, after</p>
<p>3 &nbsp; the word “and,” insert the word “any.”</p>
</div>

<p>23. When a proposed amendment in the Senate is expressed by one or more full
paragraphs, the caption should read:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p class="center">AMENDMENT</p>

<p>Intended to be proposed by Mr. <span class="smcap">Gorman</span> to the bill (H. R. 2476) entitled “An Act to establish a fish-hatching
station at Port Tobacco, Maryland,” viz: After the word “Maryland,” in line 14, section
2, insert the following:</p>

<p>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To enable the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries to carry out the provisions</p>
<p>2 &nbsp; of this act there is hereby appropriated the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 pfs100 bold">Reported Bills.</p>

<p>24. Observe the difference in <em>form</em> of action taken on Senate and House bills
reported with amendments:</p>

<p><em>House.</em>&mdash;</p>

<div class="fs80">

<p class="center smcap">December 12, 1894.</p>

<p class="center">Reported with amendments, committed to the Committee of the Whole House, and ordered to be
printed.</p>

<p class="center">Omit the parts struck through and insert the parts printed in <em>italics</em>.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Senate.</em>&mdash;</p>

<div class="fs80">

<p class="center smcap">December 13, 1894.</p>

<p class="center">Reported by Mr. <span class="smcap">Harris</span> with an amendment, viz: Omit the part struck through and insert the part
printed in <em>italics</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>[The wording varies with the necessities of the case, but the style remains the
same.]</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100 bold">General Instructions.</p>

<p>25. Spell out everything, except “Mr.,” “Mrs.,” and classification of vessels, as
“A 1.” On indorsements follow document style.</p>

<p>26. Make the contractions “&amp;c.” and “etc.” read “and so forth,” and in the title
and body of a bill make “viz” read “namely.”</p>

<p>27. When, in the use of figures, the comma is used in ordinary work to show notation,
in bills thousands and hundreds are spelled; as, for 1,750, make it “one thousand
seven hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p>28. In serial numbers, or where the comma is not used in general work, spell by
hundreds all numbers less than 10000; as, for 2742, make it “twenty-seven hundred
and forty-two;” but in serial numbers where even multiples of one thousand occur,
use the word “thousand,” as “section two thousand and four,” “paragraph seven
thousand and sixty-nine” (not “twenty hundred and four” or “seventy hundred
and sixty-nine”).</p>

<p>29. Years and dates are expressed thus: June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and
ninety-three.</p>

<p>30. When the expression usually indicated by “No.” occurs, use the word “numbered.”
Observe, in this connection, the capitalization for kindred expressions:
House Executive Document Numbered Eighteen.</p>

<p>31. References to the Revised Statutes, Statutes at Large, court reports, etc., are
expressed thus: Revised Statutes, page two hundred and forty-two; Twelfth Statutes,
page eleven hundred and sixteen; Tenth Court of Claims Reports, page ten.</p>

<p>32. Capitalize the word “act” wherever it occurs as a synonym for “bill” or
“law.”</p>

<p>33. The indorsement on a printed bill must always fall on an even page. In House
bills 4 lines of text may be worked in with the indorsement, and in Senate bills 7
lines.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100 bold">Special Instructions for Enrolled Bills.</p>

<p>34. Set in quarto measure, paragraphs indented 2 ems.</p>

<p>35. Lead with 3-to-pica leads. When center heads occur use a full pica slug above
and below.</p>

<p>36. Set entirely in roman type, except the enacting clause and “Provided,” which
go in <em>italic.</em></p>

<p>37. Avoid divisions of words and space evenly. Two-letter divisions must not be
made.</p>

<p>38. In enrolled bills of the <em>Senate</em> place the bill number (using the form “S.&nbsp;146”)
in pica antique, at the upper <em>left-hand</em> corner. In enrolled bills of the <em>House</em> the
number goes at the upper <em>right-hand</em> corner, using the form “H. R. No. 4864.”</p>

<p>39. In enrolled bills of the Senate use a parallel dash above and below title; in
those of the House use the parallel dash above only, with two full slugs below.</p>

<p class="pfs100 lsp">MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1894.</p>

<p>A message from the Senate, by Mr. Cox, its Secretary, announced that the Senate

<p>The committees were called for reports;</p>

<p>When,</p>

<p>Bills were reported, the reports thereon ordered to be printed, and referred to the
Calendars as follows:</p>

<h2 class="xl"><a name="Suggestions_for_Compositors" id="Suggestions_for_Compositors"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Suggestions for Compositors, Readers, and Revisers.</a></h2>
<hr class="r20" />

<div class="fs90">


<p class="pfs120 lsp">HELP EACH OTHER.</p>

<p>Workmen in every department should follow instructions in spirit as well as in letter. Unthinking
performance&mdash;the listless doing of just what has been told and no more&mdash;is not satisfactory. It is
believed the good workman will take interest in his duties. He is expected at suitable times to help
others in their work. The excuse that it is “none of my business,” or that “it was the reader’s
business,” or that “it was the foreman’s business” to give a word of warning or a helping hand
to prevent delay, error, or other trouble is a poor one. It is the business of every man to do what
he can to prevent error in any department, and as faulty work is usually done through inattention or
unfamiliarity with the style, suggestions should be courteously offered and received.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120 lsp">TYPESETTING.</p>

<p>For the successful maintenance of a high standard of workmanship and for the correctness of the
work done in the office, not a little depends upon the care, judgment, skill, and intelligence of the compositors.
Indifferent, careless men are not in demand in an office where important publications are
constantly being prepared for press, and where the slightest neglect on the part of those handling the
work may cause serious delay and confusion in some other division of the office. Recollect that one
badly justified line may stop a press; a careless correction spoil the whole edition of a book.</p>

<p><em>Study the rules.</em>&mdash;Compositors are expected to carefully study the rules governing composition. A
failure to do this will show plainly in the proof. It must be remembered, however, that all work
done in the office is not in accordance with the regular or office style. Special instructions will invariably
accompany copy of this kind, and a compositor should ascertain when taking out copy whether
it is to be set according to office style; if it is not, he should read instructions carefully and confer fully
with the foreman or man at the desk about doubtful questions. The kind of type for the text (other
than long primer) and the use of leads are indicated in the preparation of the copy, as are indention,
type for headlines, “cast” of tables, and other minor details. The compositor should not go wrong
on these matters, nor should his type contain many errors, if he will apply himself, think, make
certain of his instructions, and use care.</p>

<p><em>Divisions.</em>&mdash;Frequent divisions of words are undesirable, but do not avoid them entirely at the
expense of uniform spacing.</p>

<p>Do not divide compound words except at the compounding hyphen in any but extreme cases.</p>

<p>Divisions at the ends of three adjacent lines will not be passed by readers except in extreme cases
or in narrow measure.</p>

<p>Divisions on syllables of two letters should be made but rarely.</p>

<p><em>Spacing and justifying.</em>&mdash;The spacing of matter must be governed by the leading.</p>

<p>Solid matter should be spaced with 3-to-em spaces, and when about to divide a word prefer to
take in.</p>

<p>Leaded matter should also be spaced with 3-to-em spaces, but when about to divide a word prefer
to drive over.</p>

<p>In double-leaded matter en quads should be used and divisions driven over.</p>

<p>Avoid, if possible, the very thin or very wide spacing of the first line of a paragraph.</p>

<p>All lines of composition must be justified so tightly that they will stand unsupported in the stick.</p>

<p>Observe in spacing the various formations of letters. There should be less space between final
“y” and initial “w,” for instance, than between final “d” and initial “h;” less between final “o” and
initial “c” than between final “f” and initial “b.” When a little extra spacing is necessary, never
place it between a comma and the first letter of succeeding word. The spacing between capital
letters in headings should also be governed by letter formation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not do all the spacing at either the right or left of the line, but distribute it in conformity with
the foregoing suggestions. The appearance of a page as a whole depends very much upon the care
shown in spacing.</p>

<p>Compositors should take every precaution to prevent the soiling of proof sheets, as it is necessary
for the reviser to see clearly every mark on the margin of a proof after it has been corrected.</p>

<p>Do not try to cover up or hide an accident. After a proof is read the first time, if a word or line is
pied, or if a “dropout” occurs, or any accident happens to the type, it is the duty of the workman to
call attention to it in writing on the latest proof sheet, whether it be a galley revise, page revise,
stone revise, press revise, or foundry revise. If a proof sheet be not available or immediately at
hand, put the types involved <span class="fs80">FEET UPPERMOST</span> when returning them to the galley, page, or form.
This direction is intended for all who handle type&mdash;laborers, compositors, makers-up, imposers, and
electrotypers&mdash;and will be insisted upon. Accidents will happen, and correctness can be assured only
by faithfully following the instruction here given.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120 lsp">READING.</p>

<p>Readers are expected to be alert, clear-headed, diligent, and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Proofs that are overinked, pale, smeared, or that have margins too narrow for proper marking, or
for any reason are not good proofs, must be refused.</p>

<p>When a proof is taken out, the reader should inform himself fully as to the character of the work,
whether there are any special instructions or peculiarities concerning it, whether proof will be sent
out or the work go directly to press, and get such other information as he may think will assist him;
and before beginning to read he should make sure that copy agrees with proof and that the entire
proof is legible. It is well to do preparatory work and take a general survey of a proof before
beginning to read it.</p>

<p>The style in which correction marks are made on a proof is an element of considerable importance.
Straggling, unsymmetrical characters, disconnected marks placed in the margins above or below the
lines to which they relate, irregular lines leading from an incorrect letter or word to a correction,
large marks, marks made with a blunt pencil, indistinct marks, a frequent use of the eraser to
obliterate marks hastily or incorrectly made, are all faults to be avoided. Corrections so made are not
respected by the compositor, and he is frequently annoyed and delayed in deciphering what they mean
and to what they refer. In reading proof of wide tables the reader should take advantage of white
space as near as possible to the error and place the correction therein, thus aiding all who have
occasion to handle the proof afterwards.</p>

<p>The time to be spent in reading a proof should be governed, in a great measure, by its importance.
While in certain classes of ordinary work the reader is not expected to detect more than the plainer
errors and make his proof correct to copy, in work of value he should read critically and try to
discover more serious blunders than spelling, capitalization, punctuation, etc. But speed should
never be greater than is consistent with practical correctness.</p>

<p>A single reading of figures, either in columns or lines, should be sufficient. The failure of first
reader and copyholder to detect wrong figures is a serious fault; confidence in them is immediately
strained, the second readers become suspicious of all proofs read by them and feel compelled to reread
entire proof by copy, and many far-reaching annoyances are liable to follow. When a reader does
not feel positive that figures are correct to copy, or if his sight becomes confused by a multiplicity of
figures or from other cause, he should request that the proof be reread by copy by someone else.
Physical weakness is not a fault; carelessness and indifference are always culpable.</p>

<p>The substance of the preceding paragraph applies also to “fol. lit.” matter, especially bills, laws,
and court work.</p>

<p>When an entire “take” or proof seems to have been set uniformly, a reader should never make
important changes in indentions of tables or make like corrections which will cause a great deal of
work without consulting the foreman, the copy preparer, or the man at the proof table.</p>

<p>The reader should endeavor to verify, by the reference books in the office, all proper names, whether
they are of people or places, or whatever they may be; every date; every quotation from standard
works; every foreign word or phrase, and the ordinary nomenclature of science. When this can not
be done and he has a reasonable doubt, he should request the author to verify it. But when the reader
does discover errors of this class or when he detects inconsistent and erroneous statements, obviously
made by the writer through lapse of the memory or slip of the pen, it is his duty to correct. He
does so at his peril, however. He must know, not suspect, that they are errors, and be prepared, if
called upon, to vindicate the soundness of his correction by recognized authority. If he does not
know, he should query.</p>

<p>When a reader is unable to decide positively as to the correctness of a date, phrase, name, quotation,
etc., or if he does not feel at liberty to make the desired change because of instructions to
“follow” or “follow literally,” or because he is reading a bill or law, he should query. This should
not always be done by a simple question mark (for that is sometimes so confusing to the author that
he feels like raising a query of his own as to its meaning), but by writing the suggested amendment
or explaining the reason for the query in full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>In work of particular value&mdash;historic or scientific publications, books that may be used for reference,
etc.&mdash;the reader should be on the lookout for faulty construction of sentences, bad metaphors,
inconsistent statements, the misuse of words, and defects of similar character. These he should
query. The proofs of this class of work always go out, and the author will probably welcome
reasonable suggestions; but the reader must not worry himself or the author about the extreme niceties
of grammar or suggest pedantic emendations. Discrimination should be made and the author’s
style not confounded with his lapses.</p>

<p>Readers will carefully note the instructions to compositors as to spacing, division of words, etc.,
and never hesitate to mark when work is imperfect.</p>

<p>Second readers are enjoined to keep in full sympathy with first readers and copy preparers. They
must always consult with the latter before making important changes in proof, and they should feel
free to respectfully call the attention of a first reader to errors in style or blunders of any kind that
may have been frequently overlooked by him. The marks of the copy preparer must be given consideration
by all. He has probably handled the entire work and is in a position to know more about its
peculiarities than the man who reads but a small portion.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120 lsp">GALLEY-PROOF REVISING.</p>

<p>The importance of revising proofs well can not be overestimated. While a reviser is not expected
to read proof, it is not enough for him to slavishly follow the marks found on the proof sheet which
has been to the composing room for correction. His aim should be to discover new errors, if possible,
make the matter uniform in all essential points, and correct inconsistencies, due perhaps to a difference
of opinion among the readers. At the same time he should see that all corrections have been
properly made in the type, that words or lines have not been transposed by the compositor in making
the corrections, and that the rules governing spacing, division of words, and good printing generally
have been observed. Compositors have no excuse for the neglect of even spacing, either when setting
the type or when making corrections, and the reader or reviser who passes bad spacing will be held
in fault.</p>

<p>A reviser must not remodel the punctuation of the readers or make any serious changes in the work
unless the matter apparently needing correction is of unmistakable importance. If he thinks it necessary
that an important change should be made, he should submit the change proposed to the foreman
for his decision.</p>

<p>All queries made by readers must be carefully transferred to the proof to be sent out, which should
always be clean and well printed.</p>

<p>Every paragraph containing an alteration in a proof that makes one or more overruns must be reread
as first proof. It must be read aloud by copyholder, word for word, to the end of the paragraph, or at
least far enough to satisfy the reviser that the proper correction has been made and no new errors have
slipped in while the lines were being handled. The practice of revising the alteration only and of
rereading without copyholder has been the source of many errors, and will no longer be permitted.</p>

<p>Revising should be done with reasonable dispatch, but good work must not be sacrificed to haste.
The “hurry” excuse for passing bad work will not be accepted, as assistance will be furnished whenever
necessary.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120 lsp">PRESS REVISING.</p>

<p>Press revising is a branch of proof-room work requiring special adaptability and great diligence
and care. Not only must the reviser observe that the rules governing the work of those who precede
him have been followed, but he must be on the alert for a multiplicity of points not coming within
their sphere. Hence, a clear head, quick eye, knowledge of the style, acquaintance with the make-up
of various publications, a high sense of order, an ability for detail, and mind and nerves not easily
disturbed are prerequisites to success in the work.</p>

<p>A few general rules only can be given to guide the press reviser. He handles a variety of work and
must decide each point as it presents itself. He is cautioned never to allow his work to get behind
(calling for assistance when rushed), but not to make a sacrifice of correctness for the sake of speed.</p>

<p>The following rules should be carefully studied:</p>

<p>1. See that galley slips connect before beginning the page or press revise.</p>

<p>2. See that page folios are continuous, that running heads are correct and uniform, and that the
proper signature is correctly placed.</p>

<p>3. See that the series of proof sheets is clean and clear; send for another proof in case they are not.</p>

<p>4. Revise carefully, observing connections between pages, carrying all unanswered queries, and
taking care that continued and repeated lines are free from errors.</p>

<p>5. If a revise is badly corrected or is from any cause not reasonably free from error, call for another
correction and proof (stating number wanted), and destroy all duplicates.</p>

<p>6. Be on the lookout for “dropouts,” doublets, and transpositions, applying the rules laid down for
first revisers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Read by copy all running heads, and box heads in continuous tables; see that all leading lines
are carried at the top where subordinate matter turns over; that dollar marks and italic captions of
columns are properly placed and uniform; that the matter is as compact as circumstances will permit,
and that footnotes fall on the page containing the corresponding reference, and are symmetrically
arranged.</p>

<p>8. Preserve complete files of all proofs returned to the desk in the ordinary course of business, especially
of the final proofs from which a work is sent to the press or foundry.</p>

<p>9. On first page of a signature of a stone or press revise carry the number of copies and kind of
paper, with any special directions that may be necessary; and see that the form is properly imposed.</p>

<p>10. Be particular in making the “mark-off” on a galley slip when the first page proofs are sent out,
cutting the proof sheet and noting upon it the connecting galley slug, the folio of the succeeding
page, and the proper signature of the same. Retain the “mark-off” and deliver the galley slips with
the clean proof to the proof clerk.</p>

<p>11. Always make sure that different sets of proof sheets on any work are correctly marked in series,
as “R,” “2d R,” “3d R,” etc., and when a sheet is stamped “another proof” carry the same designating
“R” on the corresponding clean one, and destroy the stamped proof when it has served
its purpose.</p>

<p>12. In Court of Claims and Supreme Court records the index must be filled in by the press reviser,
the first signature being retained for that purpose.</p>

<p>13. When two or more jobs are imposed in one form, the reviser should separate the parts to verify
the imposition. Until familiar with the “fold,” however, caution must be exercised in cutting the
sheet.</p>

<p>14. Press, stone, and foundry revises are equally important. In the latter especial care must be
taken that rules do not lap, that work is not jammed in the “lockup,” that damaged letters and “slips”
are indicated, and that the matter is ready in all respects to pass severe criticism.</p>

<p>15. Government publications are usually made up in the following order:</p>

<p class="noindent pad3">
Page 1. Title.<br />
Page 2. Blank.<br />
Page 3. Table of contents. If ending on an odd-numbered page, then&mdash;<br />
Page 4. Blank.<br />
Page 5. Letter of transmittal.<br />
Page 6. Blank.<br />
Page 7. Text proper.<br />
</p>

<p>In the body of the work new pages will be properly indicated on the proof sheet. Tables of contents,
letters of transmittal, lists of illustrations, the text proper of a book, and all matter following
half titles (except parallel tables) should begin on a new odd page.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">SIGNATURES.</p>

<p>16. All signatures are designated by consecutive numbers&mdash;2, 3, 4, etc.&mdash;from the first to the last.
The distinguishing feature is usually the jacket number, preceding the signature number and
connected with it by a 2-em dash. For some works contractions of the title are used, especially in
annual or other periodical reports, forms for which can be had upon reference to the last one issued.
House and Senate documents take the following signature forms:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">H. Ex. 123&mdash;&mdash;7</td><td class="tdl">S. Rep. 13&mdash;&mdash;9</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">H. Rep. 247&mdash;&mdash;3</td><td class="tdl">S. Ex. 27&mdash;&mdash;3</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">H. Mis. 17&mdash;&mdash;2</td><td class="tdl">S. Mis. 123&mdash;&mdash;2</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">H. Ex. 13&mdash;pt 2&mdash;&mdash;5</td><td class="tdl">S. Mis. 42&mdash;pt 3&mdash;&mdash;9</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Signatures are usually worked in sixteens, but with large pages the form of eights is the standard
when printed from type.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">BILL REVISING.</p>

<p>17. In sending bills to press there are points to be watched which do not appear in other work.
The open character of the pages makes the form peculiarly liable to accident, and each page must be
closely scanned for faults. A press reviser must be fully conversant with all the details and peculiarities
of bill work and be ready to correct or take counsel upon any seeming error of style or apparent
fault. He must see that the indorsements on bills fall on “even” pages and that they back up
properly and have the proper make-up; also compare the number of the bill on the indorsement with
that on the face, as a safeguard against error. When any change has been made in the side folios, he
must run the same to the end of the series and answer for their correctness. He must see that the
proper number of copies is written on each signature page, according to the schedule or memorandum
furnished him. In short, the reviser is an umpire on bill work whose alertness is his qualification
for the work. He is not expected to read the proof, but he must train his eye to detect errors at a
glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>18. Bills are worked in forms of eights. The signatures are made up like the following:</p>

<p>19. When a bill is reprinted on account of some error or change, an asterisk is used at the foot of
the first page. When more than one signature is reprinted, the asterisk follows the signature number.</p>

<p>20. Committee bills are always confidential. If of more than eight pages the distinguishing signature
must be invented and placed on the first as well as succeeding forms. There are usually several
prints of committee bills, each of which must be distinguished by serial additions to the signature, as
A, B, C, etc.</p>

<p>21. Every paragraph which has been overrun in correcting must be read aloud by copyholder from
the proof sheet, which must be followed literally.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
